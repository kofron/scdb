These scripts will populate a database with all of the necessary
types, tables, and triggers in order for it to function as 
a slow control persistence database.  The scripts must be run in
the following order, or they will not work (there are dependencies):

    1) create_support.sql
    2) create_tables.sql <- note you need to run meta_tables to get this!
    3) create_func_trig.sql

After these are run, the database cluster should be ready for
(ab)use.
